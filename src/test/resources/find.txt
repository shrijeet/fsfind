# This is custom test data format. First few lines
# start with '#', they are comments & ignored. The first line 
# after '#' describes the purge time, search path/pattern
# and path filter. After that paths follow. Each path has a corresponding
# modification time in yyyyMMDDHHmm. Path entries start with 1/0, 1 means
# the path should be included in find output, 0 means it should not be. Next
# 1/0 indicates whether the path is a directory.
